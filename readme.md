More info: [https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq|https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq]

Install and start a local copy of redis before using this

`npm run redis-start`

This uses bull-board. you can see the queues at /admin/queues. Bull-board apparently doesn't work on safari, but chrome is ok

You can also use bull-repl:

`npm run bull-repl`
